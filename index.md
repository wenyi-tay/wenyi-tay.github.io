## Welcome to Wenyi's Homepage

This is my first personal webpage and I hope to use this to document my learning so I can look back at it in the future to see how fast or slow I have progressed. 


### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/wenyi-tay/wenyi-tay.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
